# Songs-Of-The-Hero

Project to map and correlate the many Zelda series themes, motifs and leitmotifs

## Rules and Notes

- Track numberings come from the game files or official releases and are usually not unique. The sources are documented as mush as possible.
- When a song originates in a game, but has many arrangements, there is usually a main one which will be considered the original. In case that cannot be decided, the first one in the track listing will be chosen.
- Motifs are named using the year of the first game it appeared in alongside a name as meaningful as possible.
- Motifs will be documented as necessary, as they appear in other songs. 
- - Thus, Motifs that only appear in a single song may not be documented.
